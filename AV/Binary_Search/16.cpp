/*
 Binary search on Answer Concept
  -->imp concept for further problems which we are going to solve

  --> if array is sorted (Binary search is applicable)

  --> but there are some cases/questions where array is not sorted still we can apply binary search on it.
    

    In binary search , we have low, high
      find mid;
      check whether this mid is answer or not
      then discard either half (left or right);

      In binary search on answer (in unsorted cases),
      same we will find mid , using low,high
      then we will check mid for answer (for this we need to develop criterion as per problem)
      if it is not answer,  there is a crieterion to discard one half. There creiterion has to be developed according to problem.

  It is called as binary seach , i.e. binary becuase in each iteration we are discarding one half.
